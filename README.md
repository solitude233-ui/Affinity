# Affinity

Two-dimensional affine transformation or affinity is a geometric transformation that can be applied to a two-dimensional point to map the point to a new point or to change the coordinates of the point. An affine transformation maps a straight line to a new straight line and it maps two straight parallel lines to two new straight parallel lines. An affine transformation might change the distance between two points, and it might change the angle between two non-parallel lines.
